# Amplitude-Modulation-AM-
This project demonstrates the basic implementation of amplitude modulation (AM) using Python. Amplitude modulation is a modulation method that varies the amplitude of a carrier wave depending on the information signal. This method is widely used in radio communications, television and other signal transmission applications.
