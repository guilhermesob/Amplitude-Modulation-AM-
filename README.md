# Amplitude-Modulation-AM-
This project demonstrates the basic implementation of amplitude modulation (AM) using Python. Amplitude modulation is a modulation method that varies the amplitude of a carrier wave depending on the information signal. This method is widely used in radio communications, television and other signal transmission applications.

# How it works
Amplitude modulation involves two main components:

# Information Signal (Message): 
This is the signal we want to transmit. It can be any type of signal, such as voice, image, text, etc.
Carrier Wave: A sine wave that is modulated by the amplitude of the information signal. The amplitude of the carrier wave is changed according to the information signal.
Implementation Example
The following code implements amplitude modulation for a simple information signal (a sine wave) and a carrier wave. The amplitude modulated signal is then plotted for visualization.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib

# How to Run
Clone this repository or download the source code.
Install the necessary dependencies with pip install numpy matplotlib.
Run the Python script modacao_amplitude.py.

# Preview
The script will generate three graphs:

The original information signal.
The carrier wave.
The amplitude modulated signal.

# Applications in Telecommunications
Amplitude modulation is a powerful technique that allows you to transmit information efficiently, especially in applications where bandwidth is limited. It is widely used in radio communications, television and other signal transmission applications.
